Learn the Core principles of REACT.

## REACT CORE PRINCIPLES (Summary):
1. Components: corebuilding block for making reusable pieces of HTML. There are 2 main type of components:
-A:Functional component:
```function App(props){}```
-B:Class component: (state, lifecycleMethods)
```class App exgtends React.component{}```

2. JSX: React prioritary wrapper around Javascript, that allows writing User Interface (UI) build components with familiar HTML syntax.

3. Styling components: 
- use ```ClassName``` inside JSX 
- or use Inline styling directly in Javascript.

4. Data handling: State & Props:
-STATE: to maintain and /modify data.
-PROPS: to pass data down the component three(Application).(=to allow properties to modify the way the component acts).
- setState(): to change the state.

5. Conditional Rendering: to determine which part of the UI,
   you want to display at any given time.

6. Event handling: To have strong interactivity with users

7. Life Cycle Methods: To help hook in to different timing events

8. Fetch data from an API: by using HTTP.

9. Form: How forms create a good user experience and get input from users in form elements

## WHY REACT:

-[The Virtual DOM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYbgopx44vo) leads to increased speed and performance.

- Reusable WebComponents.
- Maintained by Facebook, contributed by open source users.
- Hirable.
